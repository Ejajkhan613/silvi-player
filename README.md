# 🎥 Silvi-Player: Silent Video Player for Accelerated Learning

**Silvi-Player** is an intelligent video player designed for learners who want to watch educational videos more efficiently by **automatically skipping silent segments**—like when a tutor is writing or drawing without speaking.

## 🚀 Why Silvi-Player?

In many online learning videos, silence can take up a significant portion of time. Silvi-Player identifies these quiet moments and skips them, allowing learners to **focus on spoken explanations** and **complete videos faster**.

## 🌐 How It Works

1. User visits the Silvi-Player website.
2. Selects a video from their device.
3. Video begins processing immediately **in the browser** (no uploads).
4. As the video plays, silent segments are **automatically detected and skipped**.
5. The user completes the video faster and with more focus. 🎉

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Client-Side Processing**  
  All video and audio analysis happens directly in the user's browser.  
  - No need to upload large files  
  - Faster performance  
  - Better privacy

- 🔇 **Smart Silence Detection**
